## Special note

This is a rapid patch release of v2.1.1, right after the release of v2.1.0.

I discovered and fixed a bug and would love to release this version without waiting a week.

I know this should be very rare and certainly do not plan to make a habit of this.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Also, in case it comes up, the reverse dependency tidytuesdayR regularly fails due to it hitting a GitHub API rate limit in its tests. This is an expected false positive (we've seen it more than once now) and has nothing to do with usethis.
